# Cornbread

#### Ingredients

- [ ] Honey Butter (above), room temperature
- [ ] 2 cups coarsely ground corn meal
- [ ] 1 tsp kosher salt
- [ ] 1/2 tsp baking powder
- [ ] 1/2 tsp baking soda
- [ ] 3 tbsp sugar
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 1 1/2 cups buttermilk
- [ ] 1/2 cup lard
- [ ] 2 tbsps honey for glazing

#### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F and in a medium bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients of cornmeal, 1 tsp salt, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk. Add the dry ingredients and paddle to form a batter.
3. In a cast iron skillet, melt the lard over medium heat removing immediately once melted.
4. Add half of the melted lard to the batter and immediately paddle to avoid prematurely cooking the eggs in the batter.
5. Place the skillet back onto the heat. Once lard is shimmering, add the batter smoothing out the top. Par fry the batter until the sides just start to separate from the skillet.
6. Bake for 20 minutes.
7. Remove the skillet from the oven. Drizzle with honey, brushing it into a glaze and sprinkle with kosher salt. Allow to cool for 5 minutes. Remove the cornbread from the cast iron skillet and allow to cool for another 10 minutes.
8. Slice and serve with honey butter.
