# Breakfast Casserole

#### Ingredients

- [ ] 1 lb breakfast sausage (substitute turkey sausage by doubling the amount of butter to 8 tbsps)
- [ ] 8 count canned biscuits
- [ ] 4 tbsps butter (+ a little more for greasing the baking dish)
- [ ] 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- [ ] 1 qt milk
- [ ] 1 tbsp pepper
- [ ] 2 cups cheddar cheese, shredded
- [ ] 12 eggs

#### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and in a skillet over medium heat, start browning the sausage.
2. Meanwhile, grease a 13"x9" baking dish by rubbing butter along the surface. Rip the biscuits into 1 inch pieces and spread them around the bottom of the baking dish.
3. Once the sausage is cooked, remove from the skillet and spread over the biscuits in the baking dish. Make gravy by melting the butter along with the sausage drippings in the skillet over medium low. Vigorously whisk in the flour to begin making a roux, then, once it has turned a light golden brown, whisk in 3 cups milk and pepper until thickened into a gravy.
4. Spread the cheese in a layer in the baking dish.
5. In a mixing bowl, whisk aggs and the remaining 1 cup of milk along with salt and pepper for seasoning until homogeneous and pour into the baking dish.
6. Spread the gravy as the top layer in the baking dish.
7. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes.
8. Slice into squares and serve with fresh fruit. Serves 6 to 8 people.
