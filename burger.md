# Burger

#### Ingredients

- [ ] Dijonnaise (above)
- [ ] 1 lb ground beef
- [ ] 4 slices american cheese
- [ ] 2 eggs
- [ ] 4 pcs thick cut bacon
- [ ] 1/4 red onion, finely chopped
- [ ] 2 brioche buns

#### Method

1. Separate beef into four parts and form into balls. Make sure not to over handle them which would create a tough burger.
2. On a griddle over medium to medium-high heat, cook the bacon until done and remove.
3. Add the beef and smash each ball as thin as possible into patties and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes until the edges look crispy then flip each patty. Season with salt and pepper and add cheese. Cook for another 1 to 2 minutes and remove.
4. Cook the eggs, breaking the yolk unless over easy is desired.
5. Adjust the heat to medium low and toast the buns. Remove once toasted.
6. Add Dijonnaise and red onion to bottom and top buns then assemble by adding two patties to the bottom bun, then bacon, then egg and the top bun.
7. Serve with fries. Serves 2 people.
