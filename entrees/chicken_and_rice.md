#### Ingredients

- [ ] 4-6 chicken thighs, bone in

#### Method

1. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with 1 to 2 tsps paprika, salt and pepper. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to 24 hours.
2. While the chicken is refrigerating, rinse the rice with cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice for 15 minutes to 2 hours.
3. While the rice is soaking, prepare an aromatic purée by blending the bell pepper, onion, and garlic along with 1 tsp of water.
4. In a large skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and allow to come up to temperature. Add the chicken skin side down and sear to a golden brown. Flip the chicken and repeat on the other side, removing chicken once crispy and golden brown on both sides.
