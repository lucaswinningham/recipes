# Baked Beans

### Ingredients
- 3 cans (1 lb 12 oz) Bush’s Brown Sugar Hickory baked beans  
- 2 tbsp butter  
- 1 lb yellow onion, diced  
- 5–6 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1 tsp pepper  
- 1 tbsp BBQ rub  
  <!-- e.g., Meat Church Holy Gospel / Holy Voodoo / Killer Hogs; any sweet-smoky rub works -->
- 1 lb breakfast sausage  
- 1 smoked sausage, diced  
- 3 tbsp real maple syrup  
  <!-- Grade A Dark / “former Grade B” gives deeper maple flavor and stands up to baking -->
- 3 tbsp brown sugar  
- 3 tbsp sriracha  
- 1–2 tsp Worcestershire sauce  
- 1–2 tsp apple cider vinegar  
- 1 tsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp tomato paste  
- *(Optional heat)* ½–1 tsp chipotle powder **or** 1 tbsp adobo sauce  

### Method
1. Preheat oven to **350°F**.  
   Use middle rack if possible.

2. In a large skillet:  
   - Melt butter.  
   - Add onions, salt, pepper, and BBQ rub.  
   - Cook until onions are soft and golden at the edges (**6–8 min**).  
     - **Visual:** edges turning light brown, no raw white patches.  
   - Add garlic and cook **~1 min** until fragrant (don’t brown it).

3. In a separate skillet:  
   - Add breakfast sausage over medium heat.  
   - Break into small crumbles and cook until well-browned (**8–10 min**).  
     - **Visual:** no pink; lots of brown, crisp edges.  
     - **Sound:** steady sizzle, not boiling in liquid.  
   - Drain **50–70%** of the rendered fat (tilt skillet, spoon or pour off most of the fat, leaving a thin glossy coating).  
   - Add browned sausage to the onion/garlic skillet.

4. In the same sausage skillet (with the thin fat film):  
   - Add diced smoked sausage.  
   - Brown over medium heat (**3–5 min**) until some sides are deeply browned.  
     - **Visual:** browned spots, slightly crisp edges.  
   - Add browned smoked sausage to the onion/sausage mixture.

5. To the onion/sausage mixture, add:  
   - Maple syrup, brown sugar, sriracha  
   - Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce  
   - Tomato paste  
   - *(Optional heat)* chipotle powder or adobo sauce  
   Stir well and bring to a gentle simmer.  

   Simmer **20–30 min**, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is **thick and syrupy**.  
   - **Visual:** when you drag a spoon across the pan, the liquid takes **1–2 seconds** to flow back in.  
   - **Aroma:** deep sweet-smoky smell; vinegar sharpness mellowed.

6. Transfer the sausage mixture to a baking pan (lasagna-style pan).  
   - Add canned baked beans (undrained).  
   - Stir until evenly combined and leveled.

7. Bake **uncovered** for **45–75 min** at 350°F.  
   - Start checking around **45 min**.  
   - **Done when:**  
     - Beans are **glossy and sticky**, not soupy.  
     - Bubbles are **slow and thick**, especially around the edges.  
     - Top has some darkened, caramelized spots, but not burned.

8. Optional finish (last 10–15 min of bake):  
   - Lightly sprinkle **1–2 tsp brown sugar** and a **pinch of BBQ rub** over the top for a subtle caramelized crust.

9. Remove from oven and let rest **10–15 min** before serving.  
   - **Note:** Sauce thickens noticeably as it cools; this rest is part of the texture.  

Serves **15–20** as a side.

## Notes

### Ingredient Notes
- **Real maple syrup**  
  - Darker “Grade A Dark/Robust (former Grade B)” maple syrup has a stronger flavor that holds up to baking and reads more clearly through all the sugar and meat.  [oai_citation:0‡Barred Woods Maple](https://barredwoodsmaple.com/pages/maple-syrup-grades?srsltid=AfmBOopLKS_zxJIWMwiMI-Pq3K1cwU6JlWIyxXRa_Ht4YN2LXWAiaioF&utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

- **BBQ Rub**  
  - A sweet-smoky rub with some chili and paprika plays best here (e.g., Meat Church Holy Gospel / Holy Voodoo / Killer Hogs / any similar sweet-spicy rub). Many commercial rubs aim for a sweet–salty–spicy balance that’s ideal for beans.  [oai_citation:1‡Spirits and Spice](https://spiritsandspice.com/products/sweet-sassy-bbq-rub?srsltid=AfmBOoqOKIaQCwRjEsUVpnm9fNJxl9fVEjAvMsgjT2jwW7i2NmkZfiKe&utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

- **Soy sauce + ACV + Worcestershire**  
  - Soy + Worcestershire add umami depth; apple cider vinegar gives quiet brightness that keeps all the sweetness from feeling heavy. Serious Eats’ bean and baked-bean recipes often use vinegar at the end to balance sweetness.  [oai_citation:2‡Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/boston-baked-beans-recipe?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

- **Tomato paste**  
  - Adds body, color, and a bit of umami. Reduces with the sugars into a thicker, clingier sauce.

- **Sriracha + optional heat**  
  - Sriracha gives *background* heat and sweetness; optional chipotle/adobo adds a smoky kick. Keep chipotle/adobo on the low end for crowd-friendly “it has a kick” territory.

### Heat Options (Crowd-Friendly)
- **Default (very safe):** leave recipe as-is with sriracha only.  
- **Mild kick:** ½ tsp chipotle powder **or** 1 tbsp adobo sauce.  
- **Upper limit for a mixed crowd:** 1 tsp chipotle total.  

If you need zero heat, skip chipotle/adobo and cut sriracha back to 1–2 tbsp (or replace with ketchup).

### Texture Targets
- Simmering the sausage mixture before adding beans lets water cook off and concentrates flavor; bean starch later thickens the sauce further as it bubbles and cools.  [oai_citation:3‡Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/boston-baked-beans-recipe?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- After baking + resting, sauce should cling to the spoon and beans, not pool as a thin liquid.

### Fat Handling
- Browning sausages in **separate pans** makes draining straightforward.  
- Leaving **30–50%** of the fat behind keeps flavor and mouthfeel without making the finished beans greasy.  
- That thin film of fat in the smoked-sausage pan helps browning via the Maillard reaction.  [oai_citation:4‡Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/what-is-maillard-reaction-cooking-science?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

### Scaling (Double Batch)
- Double all ingredients.  
- Brown breakfast sausage in **two batches** so it can actually brown instead of steam.  
- Do the same for smoked sausage if the pan is crowded.  
- Simmer **30–40 min** to hit syrupy consistency (more volume = more reduction time).  
- Bake **60–90 min**, depending on pan depth and oven behavior.  
- Pan: 16-5/8" x 11-7/8" x 2-5/8" disposable roaster works well.

### Optional Finishing Touch
- Light brown-sugar + rub sprinkle in the last 10–15 min creates a very thin caramelized layer that improves both look and flavor.
