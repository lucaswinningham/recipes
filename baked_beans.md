- [ ] 1 tbsp barbecue rub <!-- recommended: Meat Church Holy Gospel, Holy Voodoo, or Killer Hogs -->
- [ ] 1 lb breakfast sausage
- [ ] 1 smoked sausage, diced
- [ ] 3 tbsps real maple syrup <!-- real maple syrup = deeper flavor -->
- [ ] 3 tbsps brown sugar
- [ ] 3 tbsps sriracha
- [ ] 1–2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- [ ] 1–2 tsp apple cider vinegar

#### Method

1. Preheat oven to **350°F**.  
   Set out:  
   - **Large skillet** (onions + simmer stage)  
   - **Small/medium skillet** (sausages)  
   - **Baking pan** (final bake)  
   - **Heat-safe bowl** for draining fat

2. In the **large skillet**, melt **butter** over medium heat. Add **onions, salt, pepper, and barbecue rub**.  
   Cook until onions are **translucent and lightly golden** (6–8 minutes).

3. Add **minced garlic** and cook **1 minute** until fragrant.

4. In a **separate skillet**, brown the **breakfast sausage** until:  
   - Crumbles are **deep brown**,  
   - Edges **crispy**,  
   - No gray or pink remains.  
   (8–10 minutes.)  
   Drain **50–70%** of fat into heat-safe bowl.  
   Transfer sausage into the large skillet with onions.

5. In the same sausage skillet, brown the **diced smoked sausage** until edges are **caramelized** (3–5 minutes).  
   Add to the large skillet.

6. In the large skillet, add:  
   - **maple syrup**  
   - **brown sugar**  
   - **sriracha**  
   - **Worcestershire sauce**  
   - **apple cider vinegar**  
   - **soy sauce**  
   - **tomato paste**  
   <!-- Add optional heat here: chipotle powder or adobo sauce -->

   Stir and simmer **20–30 minutes**, reducing until the mixture is:  
   - **Syrupy**, not watery  
   - Bubbling slowly  
   - Smells rich and caramelized

7. Transfer mixture to the **baking pan**.  
   Add all **3 cans baked beans** and stir to combine.

8. Bake **uncovered** for **45–75 minutes**.  
   Beans are done when:  
   - The surface is **glossy and sticky**  
   - **Slow bubbles** appear at edges  
   - Sauce **clings** to a spoon instead of running

9. OPTIONAL top-finish (crowd-friendly):  
   Sprinkle **1–2 tsp brown sugar + a pinch of BBQ rub** lightly over the surface for the last **10–15 minutes**.  
   Forms a shiny, lightly caramelized top.

10. Rest **10–15 minutes** before serving.  
    Sauce thickens and flavors finish melding.  
    Serves **15–20 people**.

#### Optional Heat Notes (crowd-safe)
- For a gentle “it has a kick”:  
  Add **½–1 tsp chipotle powder** *or* **1 tbsp adobo sauce** to Step 6.  
- For a no-heat version, keep only the sriracha.
