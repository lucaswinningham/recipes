# Baked Beans <!-- 13-1/2"x9-5/8"x2-3/4" pan; double batch uses larger roaster -->

Classic sweet–savory baked beans with browned sausage, maple, and a reduced syrupy base.

### Ingredients
- 3 cans (1 lb 12 oz) Bush’s Brown Sugar Hickory baked beans  
- 2 tbsp butter  
- 1 lb yellow onion, diced  
- 5–6 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1 tsp pepper  
- 1 tbsp BBQ rub  
- 1 lb breakfast sausage  
- 1 smoked sausage, diced  
- 3 tbsp **real** maple syrup  
- 3 tbsp brown sugar  
- 3 tbsp sriracha  
- 1–2 tsp Worcestershire sauce  
- 1–2 tsp apple cider vinegar  
- 1 tsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp tomato paste  
- *(Optional heat)* ½–1 tsp chipotle powder **or** 1 tbsp adobo sauce

### Method
1. Preheat oven to **350°F**.  
2. In large skillet: melt butter → add onions, salt, pepper, BBQ rub. Cook until golden (6–8 min). Add garlic (1 min).  
3. In separate skillet: brown breakfast sausage until dark + crispy (8–10 min). Drain 50–70% fat. Add to onions.  
4. Brown smoked sausage in same skillet (3–5 min). Add to onions.  
5. Add syrup, brown sugar, sriracha, Worcestershire, ACV, soy sauce, tomato paste.  
   Add optional heat if using.  
   Simmer **20–30 min** until thick + syrupy.  
6. Transfer to baking pan. Add baked beans. Stir.  
7. Bake **uncovered** **45–75 min** until glossy, sticky, and slow-bubbling.  
8. Optional: sprinkle 1–2 tsp brown sugar + pinch BBQ rub for last 10–15 min.  
9. Rest **10–15 min** before serving.  
   Serves 15–20.

## Notes

### Ingredient Notes
- **Real maple syrup**: smoother sweetness, deeper finish.  
- **BBQ Rub**: Meat Church Holy Gospel / Holy Voodoo / Killer Hogs recommended.  
- **Smoked sausage**: browning separately crisps edges (better flavor).  
- **Tomato paste**: improves thickness + color + umami.  
- **Soy sauce + ACV**: invisible balancing agents (umami + brightness).  
- **Sriracha**: default low-level heat; keeps crowd-safe.

### Heat Options (Crowd-Friendly)
- Mild kick: **½ tsp chipotle powder** or **1 tbsp adobo sauce**.  
- No heat: skip chipotle/adobo; keep sriracha.  
- More heat (but still crowd-safe): 1 tsp chipotle total.

### Texture Targets
- Reduce mixture to **syrup consistency** before adding beans.  
- After baking, beans should be **sticky and glossy**, not runny.  
- Resting 10–15 minutes thickens sauce naturally.

### Fat Handling
- Browning sausages separately makes draining easy.  
- Leave ~30–50% of fat for flavor; draining more = thicker beans.

### Scaling (Double Batch)
- Double all ingredients.  
- Brown meats in two rounds.  
- Simmer 30–40 min to reach syrup stage.  
- Bake 60–90 min depending on pan depth.  
- Use larger roaster pan (16-5/8"x11-7/8"x2-5/8").

### Optional Finishing Touch
- Light brown-sugar crust on top (1–2 tsp + pinch rub) creates subtle caramel edge.
